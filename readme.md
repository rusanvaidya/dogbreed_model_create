# **Dog Breed Classification**

This notebook builds an image classifier using Tensorflow 2.x and Tensorflow Hub.

## 1. Problem:

Idenify a image of a dog given an image of a dog.

## 2. Data:

We are using the data from kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation:

Evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

## 4. Features:

Some information about the data are :-

   * We are dealing with images (unstructured data) so its probabily best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
   * There are 120 different breeds of dog (this means there are 120 different classes)
   * There are 10,000+ images in training sets. (these images have labels)
   * There are around 10,000+ images in the test set. (these images will have no label because we will want to predict  them)
